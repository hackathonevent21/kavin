<h1 style="text-align: center";> The Solar System </h1>
<p style="text-align: center";> There are 8 Planets in the Solar System.Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. All of these planets revolve around a star which we call the sun.so now lets see why the solar system is so unique. </p>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: left";> The Sun </h2>
<img src="https://media.nationalgeographic.org/assets/photos/000/290/29094.jpg" width="500" height="450" style="float: left"/> 
<p > The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core,radiating the energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet light,and infrared radiation. It is the heart of the solar system, without it all the planets will float away and life cannot survive.</p>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: left";> Mercury  </h2>

<p style="text-align: left";> The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.
<br>
 <h2 style="text-align: left";> Venus </h2>
 <img src="https://solarearthusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maxresdefault-288.jpg" width="750" height="400" style="float: left"/> 
 <p style="text-align: left";>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density. These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between the two worlds. Scientists think it’s possible some volcanoes are still active. </p>		
 <br>
 <h2 style="text-align:left";> Earth </h2>

 <p style="text-align: left";> Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things. While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”
 <h2 style="text-align:left";> Mars </h2>
 <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/OSIRIS_Mars_true_color.jpg" width="500" height="500" style="float: left"/>
 <p style="text-align: left";> Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. There is strong evidence Mars was—billions of years ago—wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past. It is also the 4th planet away from the sun.   1 year = 687 Earth days or 1.88 Earth years. The radius of Mars is 3, 389.5 km and the diameter is 6,779 km.Mars is one of the most explored planets in our Solar System, and it is the only   planet that we have sent rovers to explore the planet. It has 2 rovers, 1 lander, and one helicopter on Martian Soil. Mars means the Roman Goddess of War and is referred to as the red planet because of its dusty winds.  </p>
 <h2 style="text-align:left";>Jupter </h2>

 <p style="text-align: left";> jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe.

 Jupiter Resources
Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.
Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left";> Saturn </h2>
<img src="http://astronomy.com/~/media/8869F96544004BA298FE10708769601D.jpg" width="500" height="500" style="float: left"/>
<p style="text-align: left";> Saturn is a Gas Giant which is the 6th Planet away from the Sun.  It is the second-largest planet in the Solar System, after Jupiter. Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings – made of chunks of ice and rock – but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's. Saturn is named after the Roman father of Jupiter.
Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. It can not be suitable for human colonization as it is a Gas Giant.</p>
 <h2 style="text-align:left";> Uranus </h2>

 <p style="text-align: left";>Uranus is a Gas Giant, it is the 3RD largest planet in the Solar System. Uranus also has Rings but it is barely visible.
Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares, grandfather of Zeus and father of Cronus. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. </p>
 <h2 style="text-align:left";> Neptune <h2> 
 <img src="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/system/feature_items/images/82_carousel_neptune_1.jpg" width="500" height="500" style="float: left"/>
 <p style="text-align: left";>The planet Neptune is named after the Roman God of the sea. In Greek mythology, he is known as Poseidon. The planet was probably given this name due to its blue appearance. Blue color is due to Methane gas. Neptune's atmosphere is made out of gas. 
Interesting fact about Neptune is that it is the first planet to be discovered by the use of mathematical calculations and predictions.
It is the giant planet in the solar system. The core of Neptune is about 1.5 times the size of Earth.
Neptune has a powerful magnetic field. It is 27 times stronger than Earth’s magnetic field.
